# Success criteria

This document outlines the success criteria for project laika.

### Phase 1

The project has been broken down in to short phases. The first phase will aim to deliver the outputs to satisfy the success criteria below.

1. Review potential sources of satellite imagery
2. Implement an existing satellite segmentation algorithm
3. Document and communicate the algorithm
4. Define the high level pipeline
5. Develop and test a model for collaborative project work

### Further Detail

1. Review potential sources of satellite imagery

A crucial component in the successful application of the proposed pipeline will be the data required to support the methodology. Understanding the availability and ease of access to appropriate data is important in assessing the viability of the pipeline. This project aims to identify a source or methodology that can be used for future satellite imagery projects.

2. Implement an existing satellite segmentation algorithm

As a proof of concept, an existing methodology will be implemented. This will allow us to assess the hardware we have available in the campus and also allow us to better understand the required components of a generalised pipeline which will be developed in future phases of the project. This first phase should take some satellite data, perform a segmentation and return classifications. 

3. Document and communicate the segmentation algorithm

Write up the implementation work on satellite segmentation and share through the team. A show and tell will give others in the campus an opportunity to comment on the work so far and discuss future work.

4. Define the high level pipeline

At the end of phase 1 we want to be able to visualise the components of the pipeline from end to end. This will define each stage and also what needs to be developed to ensure that transitions between stages are fluent. This overview of the pipeline will shape the next phase of the project and allow us to efficiently assess the most beneficial enhancements for future work and application.

5. Develop and test a model for collaborative work.

As one of the first collaborative projects in the campus we will test a methodology for project work using agreed tools and techniques. Once this model has been decided and tested through Phase 1 it will be reviewed, documented and shared to the campus for feedback. Beyond this project we can have a demonstrable example of a project framework and can support the wider team in embedding it in other projects.
