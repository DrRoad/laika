# Success Criteria - project laika

This document outlines the success criteria for project laika.

### Phase 1

1. Review potential sources of satellite imagery
2. Implement an existing satellite segmentation algorithm 
3. Document and communicate the algorithm 
4. Define the high level pipeline
5. Develop and test a model for collaborative project work

### Further Detail

1. Review potential sources of satellite imagery
A crucial component in the successful application of the proposed pipeline will be the data required to support the methodology. Understanding the availability and ease of access to appropriate data is important in assessing the viability of the pipeline. 

2. Implement an existing satellite segmentation algorithm
As a proof of concept, an existing methodology will be implemented. This will allow us to assess the hardware we have available in the campus and also allow us to better understand the required components of a generalised pipeline. 

3. Document and communicate the segmentation algorithm
Write up the implementation work on satellite segmentation and share through the team. A show and tell will give others in the campus an opportunity to comment on the work so far and discuss future work. 

4. Define the high level pipeline
At the end of phase 1 we want to be able to visualise the components of the pipeline from end to end. This will define each stage and also what needs to be developed to ensure that transitions between stages are fluent.

5. Develop and test a model for collaborative work.
As one of the first collaborative projects in the campus we will test a methodology for project work using agreed tools and techniques. Once this model has been decided and tested through Phase 1 it will be reviewed, documented and shared to the campus for feedback
