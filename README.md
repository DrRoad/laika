# laika

The Data Science Campus have many projects in their backlog that involve some form of computer vision challenge. These range from using satellite imagery for land use problems to using crowd sourced photographs for object detection.

Project Laika aims to develop an image processing and analysis pipeline that can be used to satisfy the computer vision component of future projects. 

### Phase 1 - satellite segmentation

The first project phase will implement an existing image segmentation algorithm as a proof of concept for the pipeline.

### Future Phases

Future phases will aim to enhance components of the pipeline to allow for different types of images (satellite/photos), different computer vision problems (classification / detection / segmentation) different algorithm architectures and appropriate output modules.
